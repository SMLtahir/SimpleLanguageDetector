# SimpleLanguageDetector

This can be used to detect the language of any input text including languages of non-latin script like Hindi and Russian. This project can very easily be extended to include more languages on the same concept as well. Finally, this is a very simple implementation of a language detector. More sophisticated NLP can be used to develop a better language detector, like usage of character ngrams for example. This project works well with medium to high number of words in the text but for very low length texts, more sophisticated ways must be used (like character ngrams).
